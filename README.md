Frameworks, libraries & programs used
- vsCode: The vscode is used to code and develop the project.
- Git: The Git was used for version control to commit to Git and push to GitHub.
- GitHub: The GitHub is used to host the project.

# Testing tools used

Testing During Development
As mentioned at the start much of the testing my JavaScript code was done throughout the
development process using console.log within each function to report on what variables and
arrays were being generated at each stage of the site. Read the output and used breakpoint
and console network to check the location of my errors and the movement action as i
manually tested them. that allowed

- Autoprefixer
• Autoprefixer is used to parsethe CSS and to add vendor prefixes to CSS rules.
- W3C Markup Validation Service
• The W3C MarkUp Validation Service is used to check whether errors in the
HTML5 code.
- W3C CSS validator
• The W3C CSS validator is used to check errors in the CSS3 code.
- Joshing
• JShint is a JavaScript validator is used to check any errors in the JavaScript
code.

# More Tools
- Tinypng: Used to re-size images.
- Google Developer Tools: The GitHub is used to host the project and test the project through the console
and lighthouse.

## Features

After identifying the user stories I managed to identify the features for the
website to help me with the development roadmap.And then created tasks based on userstories

### Installing

How to get the project started. First clone the repo and then to install the dependencies e.g.


### Running

To run the NextJS app use the commands below and run to start the project:

Run the following commands on the terminal:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Contributing

- Responsiveness
  
Google Developer tools was used to test the layout of my site on multiple device sizes, and
also shared the deployed site with family and friends for them to test on their devices too.

- Performance
  
Lighthouse tool on the Google Developer software was useful to test the performance of my
site. It flagged several errors which some were resolved using the console.The project could
do with more debugging and testing. The performance needs further investigation and acting
on the lighthouse suggested points of improvement.

A thank you to lectures at Noroff Institute and Admin employee for all their help during the studies.

## Deploy on Vercel

Used the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.


### Goal
As a developer, you will have to maintain a level of professionalism. This extends past writing code. We need to document our apps so that other developers can run the code without any issues. We also need to keep a professional-looking portfolio so that others have confidence in us and the work that we do.

## Project Brief
In this assignment, you will be documenting three prior submissions from the first year:
- Semester Project 2
- JavaScript Frameworks CA
- Project Exam 2
  
### You will be creating a README.md file at the root of each of these projects and then documenting the submissions following a given format.

### You will then also be creating a README.md for your own personal GitHub profile.

### Lastly, you will be creating a portfolio webpage that lists these 3 projects.

### This page must:
List the 3 projects as cards
Each card must have:
the title of the project,
- a description,
- a screenshot of how the project looks when running,
- a link to the GitHub repo and a live site if it is online.
